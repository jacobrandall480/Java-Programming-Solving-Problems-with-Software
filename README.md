## Overview
This repository contains the solutions to programming assignments from the course "**Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software**".

This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming) is offered by Duke University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

### Notes
All samples of code had been writing and tested in BlueJ IDE. Duke recommends using a [custom version of BlueJ](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).

Some code use extra packages, these packages are included by default in Duke's custom version of BlueJ:
- [edu.duke](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/archives/courserajava.jar)
- [org.apache.commons.csv](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/archives/apache-csv.jar)
